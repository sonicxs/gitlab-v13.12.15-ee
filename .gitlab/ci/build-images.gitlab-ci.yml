# This image is used by the `review-qa-*` jobs. The image name is also passed to the downstream `omnibus-gitlab-mirror` pipeline
# triggered by `package-and-qa` so that it doesn't have to rebuild it a second time. The downstream `omnibus-gitlab-mirror` pipeline
# itself passes the image name to the `gitlab-qa-mirror` pipeline so that it can use it instead of inferring an end-to-end image
# from the GitLab image built by the downstream `omnibus-gitlab-mirror` pipeline.
# See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/testing_guide/end_to_end/index.html#testing-code-in-merge-requests for more details.
