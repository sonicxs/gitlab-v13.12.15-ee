# Users pending approval

A user in _pending approval_ state requires action by an administrator. A user sign up can be in a
pending approval state because an administrator has enabled either, or both, of the following
options:

- [Require admin approval for new sign-ups](settings/sign_up_restrictions.md#require-administrator-approval-for-new-sign-ups) setting.
- [User cap](settings/sign_up_restrictions.md#user-cap).

When a user registers for an account while this setting is enabled:

- The user is placed in a **Pending approval** state.
- The user sees a message telling them their account is awaiting approval by an administrator.

A user pending approval:

- Is functionally identical to a [blocked](moderate_users.md#blocking-a-user) user.
- Cannot sign in.
- Cannot access Git repositories or the GitLab API.
- Does not receive any notifications from GitLab.
- Does not consume a [seat](../../subscriptions/self_managed/index.md#billable-users).

An administrator must [approve their sign up](#approve-or-reject-a-user-sign-up) to allow them to
sign in.

## View user sign ups pending approval

## Approve or reject a user sign up

A user sign up pending approval can be approved or rejected from the Admin Area.

To approve or reject a user sign up:

1. Go to  **Admin Area > Overview > Users**.

Approving a user:
